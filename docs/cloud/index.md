# Running in the Cloud

The Docnow App has been successfully tested to run on the following Cloud Service Providers:

* [AWS](https://docnow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cloud/aws/)
* [Digital Ocean](https://docnow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cloud/digital-ocean/)
* [Scaleway](https://docnow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cloud/scaleway/)


Installing DocNow in the cloud will cost money, both for running a server and collecting and storing data. You will need a credit card and cloud service provider account to continue.  

The installation will be the same as Documenting the Now's [Community Instance](https://community.docnow.io) but will be under your full management. You will be the administrator of the application, which gives the privileges of user management, ability to edit Terms of Service, and other settings.
