# Running in the Cloud

The Docnow App has been successfully tested to run on the following Cloud Providers. The instructions here will cost you money. In all cases you will need to sign up to set up your own customized Docnow App. 

The installation will match or even exceed [Community Instance](https://community.docnow.io) but will be under your full management. 

Some of the limitations will include:
* the resulting URL cannot be shared for use with others
* the installation will not always be network connected (a requirement of the app to collect tweets)
* the installations performance will be impacted by other applications are running on your computer
