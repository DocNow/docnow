# Running Locally

The Docnow App can be run as a local installation on a computer under your control. These instructions assume you have administrator (elevated) privileges on your local personal computer. 

## Why run locally?

The use case for running locally is to learn what the DocNow app is built on and what features it has. The application will only function so long as you are actively running it in your terminal. It will have scaled down capabilities compared the [Community Instance](https://community.docnow.io), but will be on your personal computer with your own full control as administrator. 

Some of the limitations will include:

* the resulting URL cannot be shared for use with others
* the installation will not always be network connected (a requirement of the app to collect tweets)
* the installations performance will be impacted by other applications are running on your computer

## Instructions per operating system

* CentOS
* MacOS
* Microsoft Windows
* Ubuntu
