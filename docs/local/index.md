# Running Locally

The Docnow App can be run as a local installation on a computer under your control. The instructions assume you have administrator (elevated) privileges on your local personal computer. 

The use case for this is to find out what the Docnow App is capable of. The installation will have scaled down capabilities as the [Community Instance](https://community.docnow.io) but will be on your personal computer. 

Some of the limitations will include:
* the resulting URL cannot be shared for use with others
* the installation will not always be network connected (a requirement of the app to collect tweets)
* the installations performance will be impacted by other applications are running on your computer
