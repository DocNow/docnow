# Terms of Service

DocNow is an application that pulls data from Twitter APIs. The application follows Twitter’s [Developer Agreement and Policy] for data collection and sharing. DocNow was created by the Documenting the Now project, which hosts an instance of the tool for community use. As a user of Documenting the Now’s DocNow community instance, you are bound by Twitter’s Developer policies and Twitter’s user [rules and policies].

Additional terms of service from Documenting the Now follow.

## Transparency

Documenting the Now believes in transparency in data collection and encourages the gathering of consent from content creators. By using our application you agree to share collections publicly via the Collections page, tweet notifications of your collecting on Twitter using the Twitter account you have logged in with, and solicit the consent of creators for collecting their data from Twitter. If a content creator revokes consent, you will take steps to remove that content from your collection upon download from DocNow.

## Data Storage

Documenting the Now is limited by Twitter to collecting 10 million tweets per month. This limit is programmatically split between all users within the DocNow instance. Documenting the Now will monitor monthly data collection and notify users via email[^1] of stoppages or deletions needed to accommodate all users. Documenting the Now is not responsible for data loss events in any circumstance. The tool and service are provided to the community at no cost to develop a community of ethical practice for social media archives. It is recommended that users regularly download their Tweet ID archives to ensure access to data. If large-scale, persistent, long term data collection is needed, Documenting the Now recommends installing and administering a separate DocNow instance.  

## Privacy Policy

Documenting the Now collects Twitter profile data as a requirement for application functionality. This information is linked to data collecting and shared via the public Collections page as part of the application’s commitment to transparency in data collection. 

Documenting the Now also collects email addresses on an opt-in basis. The email address you provide may be used to send you information, notifications about content creators interacting with your collections, and to respond to inquiries, and/or other requests or questions. Contact information will never be sold or re-used by Documenting the Now outside of the aforementioned application features.

[^1]: If an email account is not provided on the user’s profile page, the user will not be contacted. See the Privacy Policy above for more details.
